  <p>Hi, my name is {name} and I'm writing to urge President Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and to end
    all aid to Israel that is fueling the genocide in Gaza. The U.S. provides $3.8 billion/year in military funding to
    Israel, along with weapons and diplomatic cover. President Biden has promised to send another $14.3 billion for
    Israel's mass killings of Palestinian people, actively fueling genocide while blocking a ceasefire. We need a
    ceasefire now and an end to U.S. military funding to Israel.</p>
